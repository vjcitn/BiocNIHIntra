Bioconductor examples for NIH Intramural demonstrations of AnVIL

First vignette addresses

- learning about SummarizedExperiment to manage multiple samples
constituting reference expression data on selected cell types
- learning about SingleCellExperiment to work with expression
patterns on thousands of cells
- using the SingleR package and function to train a
classifier of cell types and label a sample of PBMCs
assayed with TENx
- projecting expression patterns for visualization using approximate PCA
- using plotly to visualize clusters with labels
