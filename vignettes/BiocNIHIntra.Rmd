# Purpose

This package provides a very brief introduction to
the use of Bioconductor packages and functions to
work with single cell RNA-seq data.  

Tasks in the first vignette include

- learning about SummarizedExperiment to manage multiple samples
constituting reference expression data on selected cell types
- learning about SingleCellExperiment to work with expression
patterns on thousands of cells
- using the SingleR package and function to train a 
classifier of cell types and label a sample of PBMCs
assayed with TENx
- projecting expression patterns for visualization using approximate PCA
- using plotly to visualize clusters with labels

See "Articles" for further details.
